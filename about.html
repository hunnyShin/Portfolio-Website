          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Julie, and I am a user interface designer.()
            I find value in a working environment where I can experience, learn, and professionally grow as a UI/UX designer. Also, I prefer great corporate welfare and a casual atmosphere at work, and I desire to work at a company that influences
            society positively and grows with employees.
          <p>
            I have a positive attitude in the face of challenges, and I am very patient in solving problems. One of my strengths is the ability to adapt to new company culture, and I love working with a team. I am a good listener, and I love
            collaborating with people and enjoy accepting new things. If I write three words that indicate me, it can be “patient,” “effort,” and “faithful.”
